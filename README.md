# tdl++ - Simple text-based Todo List

A lightweight, simple text-based todo list application built with C++. This is not efficient at all, but I wanted to try something new for once.
## Features

- Lightweight: Average of 2.7MB RAM Usage with the conhost using the most of it
- Clean & simple command-line interface with easy-to-remember commands and helpful prompts
- Your tasks are automatically saved during sessions in plain text to the same folder where executable is
- Add, remove & schedule tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- View the list of pending tasks


## Roadmap

- Expand more on the task statistics
- Make it so tasks are saved in appdata
- Maybe new features (?)
