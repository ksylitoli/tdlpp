# tdl++

Simple text-based Todo list made using C++. This is not efficient at all and the code might be broken and unoptimized, but I wanted to try something new for once.
## Features

- Simple command-line interface
- Add & remove tasks
- Schedule tasks 
- Mark tasks as complete
- Clear command outputs & completed tasks
- View task statistics: Tasks pending
- View the list of pending tasks as well as statistics
- Persistent storage in local file

## Roadmap

- More features (probably ;D)
- Expand more on the task statistics
- Optimize the code and make it more readable
