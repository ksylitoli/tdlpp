# tdl++ - Simple text-based Todo List

A lightweight, simple text-based todo list application built with C++. This is not efficient at all and the code might be broken and unoptimized, but I wanted to try something new for once.
## Features

- Lightweight: Average of 2.5MB RAM Usage
- Clean & simple command-line interface with easy-to-remember commands with helpful prompts
- Your tasks are automatically saved between sessions in plain text
- Add, remove & schedule tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- View the list of pending tasks


## Roadmap

- More features (probably ;D)
- Expand more on the task statistics
- Make the code somewhat readable =D
